c. Socket.io

d. All of the above

****
**Answer** d. All of the above
- express is a popular web application framework for node.js used for http server scripting.
- body-parser is a middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a node.js application, but now we wont need body-parser as express-parser inbuilt with express module.
- socket.io provides real time, bi-directional communication between client and server.
